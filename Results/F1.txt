At ‘Oxford Men's only English language competition’
200 people were participating

Challenge was to express Peacefulness, Happiness
and Calmness...
...in a single sentence.

Person who won
he wrote:
"MY WIFE IS SLEEPING"

He received a standing ovation form all the judges
and audience, and one married Judge actually ran
to the stage, hugged him with tears in his eyes and
said "you are a genius!"
